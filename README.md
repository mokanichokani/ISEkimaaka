*This demo shows the user triggering the extension on a webpage and receiving an instant analysis as an on-page overlay.*

## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **Analyze Anything, Anywhere:** Works on any website to analyze questions, text, or images directly from your screen.
*   **Instant On-Page Results:** The AI's response appears as a clean, temporary overlay, so you never have to leave your current tab.
*   **Privacy-First Design:** The extension is completely dormant until you explicitly call it. It has no access to your browsing data until the moment you trigger it.
*   **Zero Configuration:** No login or personal API key is required. The extension securely handles API access through a backend server.
*   **Customizable Shortcut:** Activate the analysis with the default `Ctrl+Shift+Y` / `Cmd+Shift+Y` shortcut, or change it to whatever you prefer in Chrome's settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This extension is built with security and efficiency in mind, using a modern programmatic injection model.

1.  **User Trigger:** The user presses the keyboard shortcut or clicks the action popup button.
2.  **Page Validation:** The background script checks that the current page is not a protected URL (like `chrome://` pages).
3.  **On-Demand Injection:** If the page is valid, the background script programmatically injects `content.js` and `content.css` into the active tab. These files do not run persistently on all pages.
4.  **Secure API Key Fetch:** The background script calls a dedicated backend server to get a temporary Gemini API key. No user data is sent in this request.
5.  **Screen Capture:** The extension captures a PNG of the visible portion of the active tab.
6.  **AI Analysis:** The captured image is sent to the Google Gemini Vision API for analysis. The image is processed ephemerally and is not stored.
7.  **Display Result:** The Gemini API response is sent back to the `content.js` script, which then creates and displays the overlay with the answer. The overlay fades out automatically after a few seconds.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend (Extension):**
    *   Plain JavaScript (ES6+)
    *   HTML5 & CSS3
    *   Chrome Extension APIs (Manifest V3), primarily:
        *   `chrome.scripting` for programmatic injection.
        *   `chrome.commands` for keyboard shortcuts.
        *   `chrome.action` for the popup.
        *   `chrome.tabs` for screen capture.

*   **Backend:**
    *   Node.js / Express.js (or similar) for the API server.
    *   Hosted on Render (or any cloud provider).
    *   **Purpose:** To securely store and provide the Gemini API key to the extension without exposing it on the client-side.

*   **AI Service:**
    *   Google Gemini Vision API
